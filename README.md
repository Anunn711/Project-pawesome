# project-pawsome
Our proposal is to make a web app that will help dog owners stay organized and on top of their dog's wellness.

This app will allow users to give the breed, weight, and other information about their dog in order to get useful information such as what and when to feed their dog, what to buy for them, and also personalized recommendations for groomers and vets in their area. If any vet or groomer appointments are made, then they will be kept track of.

- Feeding and grooming guides (what, when, how) based on the dog's breed
- Find vets/groomers near you and make appointments
- Personalized product recommendations

*AS of right now the google api is not working because the credits have run out, the application's map display will work upon google api credits being restored.*
